=======================

This project is a [Katalon Studio]() project where I develop a few Custom Keywords to share with other Katalon Studio projects. The custom keywords belongs to
the Groovy package name `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard`.

Groovy classes includes:

- `com.kazurayam.ksbackyard.Assert` --- Synonym to `org.junit.Assert` but reports to Katalon Studio's Logging system.
